I worked on this project alone.

# Known Bugs
There is a small bug/unexpected behavior in both my implementation and the sample implementation, `sampleish`.
It is possible for a child process to be orphaned,
when the shell exits early due to an error shuch as `fork()` failing.

I have confirmed that this behavior exists for `sampleish` using the folling method.
1) $ systemd-run --user --collect --pty -p TasksMax=3 /bin/sh
2) $ ./sampleish
3) % sleep 100 | ls
4) The shell exits with a resource temporarily  unavailable error.
5) On a different terminal, run `htop` to confirm a `sleep` process exists.
