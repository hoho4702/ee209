# Assignment 5: A Unix Shell

## Build
```sh
$ make
```

NOTE: You should modify Makefile for your shell.

## Testing (Example)
1. Build `ish` by running `make`.
2. Run `./tools/test.py`.
3. If you want to run specific test, use `-f` option.
For example,

```sh
$ ./tools/test.py -f simple_test01
```

To validate whether your testing works, use `sampleish`.
```sh
$ cp sampleish ish
$ ./tools/test.py
```

This should pass all provided test cases.

## Submission
1. Make `readme` and put `EthicsOath.pdf` to the current directory.
2. Change your `STUDENT_ID` with yours.
3. Run 
```sh
$ make submit
```

WARNING: Currently, we only include `*.c` and `*.h`.
If you have subdirectories, please modify `Makefile` properly.

4. Submit your `$(STUDENT_ID)_assign5.tar.gz`.

I searched internet(google,naver,lecture notes,more ex exams) about (signals, shell labs and pipes..etc)
This assgnment was very hard that the time was so tight and I had to take my final exams too.
I asked to friendly senior(in cs) but I just make my code myslef. I just asked for a tip.
In available time, I studued for a long time, and when the time limits come, I invested my all time in this assignment. 
I think my code just pass my testcases.. If it can,, I wanna see the answer shit or some more after my assignment be submited.
This assignment was the hardest homework.. 
Total time will be more than 70 hours.(I think..)

From this ee209 I feel there's so many people that are good at coding.
But it was quite fun for me. Thank you for teaching me ee209.Thx
