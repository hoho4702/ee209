- Additional Comments

  - Because it was the end of semester, along with EE209 Assignment5,
    I had three projects going on, along with final exams, then had to
    move cities for an internship. I tried my best to start early and
    sacrificed many days and nights whenever I had time for this
    assignment. But It was not enough compared to the time I spent for
    other assignments, and I sincerely apologize for not being able to
    finish the assignment fully.

  - I really tried hard for this course and I am really grateful for
    how much I improved and grew. But on the other hand, it leaves me
    such remorse and heartbreak of what I could have done better.

  - In the last couple of weeks I had to deal with past traumas
    unexpectedly. Combined with a condition that impacts my ability
    to focus and manage assignments, I had to really force myself to
    limits, to at least try, and hoping to finish my shell.

  - I didn't plan on disclosing this, but I would be really thankful
    if this information could be taken into consideration in evaluation.
    If there is any document or additional information I could provide,
    I would be glad to supply.

  - But overall, I am really grateful for what I learned in this
    course, and am really glad I pushed through to the end. I found joy
    in programming, which I didn't think would ever be possible. I grew
    my skills and confidence to apply to an internship as a programmer.
    I'm really grateful and thankful for the opportunity to take EE209.
