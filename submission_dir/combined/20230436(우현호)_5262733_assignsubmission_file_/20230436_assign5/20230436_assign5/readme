Assignment 5 : Unix Shell
20230436 우현호
I refered to websites and lecture note to study io management, 
process management(fork, execvp,...), signal.

Time spent : ~ 20 hrs
Known Bugs : 
- I didn't implement pipe handling
- Result and expected outputs differ due to the position 
of the % prefix when commands from .ishrc are printed.

Description : Used provided Dynamic Array ADT.
Modular design with functions such as execute_command for handling commands and redirections, and shellHelper for parsing and executing user input or commands
from .ishrc. 
Key techniques : Dynamic tokenization (lexLine and syntaxCheck) to
parse user input, process forking (fork) to execute commands.
Signal handling (SIGQUIT, SIGALRM) to manage shell-specific behaviors like quit prompts.
