Work division: I did it by myself
Help: No I didn't get help from others
Time: 20 hrs
Add info.: I was tried to make a error command same with sampleish, but in Python it makes problems wrong (adding Invalid: makes problem) So I removed all "Invalid: " in my code
But I'm not sure whether it will make a problem. If it does, please let me know. Thanks for this semester.
