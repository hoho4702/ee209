Description of work division: I work alone

Description of whatever help: I look Lecture slides of EE209, Video that TA explain about assignment, EE209 campuswire.
But, I was not so good at coding, so the above data alone was limited. So, I looked up a lot of YouTube lectures and Google blogs related to UNIX Shell. Fortunately, I studied using the fork function, process management, and memory management while studying for the final exam, so I think I was able to be relatively okay.

Indication of how much time I spent doing the assignment: 5days
