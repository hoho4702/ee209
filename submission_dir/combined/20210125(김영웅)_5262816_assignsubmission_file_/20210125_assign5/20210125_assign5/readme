I spent 18 hours to do this assignment(alone).
Actually, I don't fully understand about how can I change Makefile to make my own Makefile. 
I am not taking class EE485, So I read https://makefiletutorial.com/ carefully.
I use gcc209, and -D_DEFAULT_SOURCE, -D_GNU_SOURCE options. 
But I didn't modify Makefile much.
