Work Division (We did this assignment by our selves)
I
    - Make Makefile
    - Prgrammed
        Generate Child Process and simple excute command
        Function makecommand
        Mange Back Ground Process with Signal Hnadling
        Redirection

My Partner
    - Prgrammed
        Generate Child Process and simple excute command
        Builtin Command (cd, exit, setenv, unsetenv)
        Signal Handling (SIGINT, SIGQUIT)

Time Line
- 2024.11.01
    Team made
- 2024.12.08
    First meating : Planing for assignment
- ~ 2024.12.10
    Understanding given codes and make Makefile
- 2024.12.10
    Second meating : Understanding given codes and make Makefile
- 2024.12.18
    I
    1. Change makecommand function
        Before : dynamically allocate the array to store the pointer
            of each command token string
        Problem : Unknown error occurs during allocate the array

        Solve (After) : make local pointer array to store
            the pointer of each command token string,
            and pass it to makecommand function.
            In makecommand function, just modify passed array.
    
    2. Add Background process Management
- 2024.12.19 ~ 2024.12.20
    Third meating
        I
        1. Solve Problem in Background Process Management
            Problem
            : When two background process exist,
                after the first background process is terminated,
                the shell doesn't executed to user
                before second background process is terminated.

            Solve
            : Iterate background process linked list,
                and check those processes are terminated or not.
            If one background process is found to be terminated,
                then after manage for termination,
                and just return the SIGCHLD signal handler.
            If no background process is terminated,
                then just return the SIGCHLD signal handler
        
        2. Add Redirection
            Divide 4 cases for redirection, and manage the redirection
            1) No Redireciton exists
            2) Only Redirection out exists
            3) Only Redirection in exists
            4) Both Redirection out and in exist
        
        3. Help my partner to complete
            1) `cd` command
                I added the parameter cheking logic to handle edge cases
                such as invalid no parameter (ex. `cd &`)
                and more than 2 parameters (ex. `cd a b`)
            2) Signal handling (SIGQUIT)
                Problem
                : When user typed Ctrl-\,
                    after 5 seconds first Ctrl-\ typing,
                    the ish program terminated

                Solve
                : Change static local variable(type_count) to global.
                And then add the reset logic in the SIGALRM handler
                to reset waiting for second Ctrl-\ input for 5 second
                after first Ctrl-\ typed

        My Partner
        1. Add Builtin Command Management
            My partner programmed to execute below builtin commands.
            1) cd 2) exit 3) setenv 4) unsetenv
        
        2. Add signal handling (SIGINT, SIGQUIT)
            My partner programmed to handle signals (SIGINT, SIGQUIT).

    My Partner tried to implement the pipe. (Main Structure)
- 2024.12.22
    I editted the implement of the pipe programmed by my partner
    1) When generate each command in pipes,
        I make each command by adding new variable
        to store next pipe line index
        Then, I executed result command.
    2) I modified the process of storing the index of pipes
        by passing the locally defined result index array,
        and check the current token is pipe or not
            by checking the eType in Token structure
    
    +) My partner found edge cases
        When setenv and unsetenv with no arguments,
        our ish doesn't print any error message
    => I add argument checking process to print the error message
        to above edge cases
