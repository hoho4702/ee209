Looked into the following reddit thread for some help with
warning suppression; https://www.reddit.com/r/C_Programming/comments/18fm6fz/what_is_a_good_dummy_statement_to_prevent/

Checked this blog for info on snprintf:

This was an incredibly difficult assignment. It was complex
but I think the end product was cool.
