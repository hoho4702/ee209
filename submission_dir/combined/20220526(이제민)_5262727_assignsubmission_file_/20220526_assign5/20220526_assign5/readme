## Basic Information
Name: 이제민
Student ID: 20220526
Assignment number: 5
Time spend on assignment: Approx. 30 hours

## Help received
No one helped my assignment in person.

However, I used a code that assignment and lecture note provided, as recommended.
I was helped by a lot of internet information sources, but I never copy/pasted the code in internet.
(The list of links I looked cannot be provided here because it's so vast and I cannot remember all of the sources I got informations form.)

## Assessment of the assignment
I could learn about how shell works, and the fact that shell itself is just another form of (possibly c) code.
