[assessment]
It was useful experience to implement very basic shell.
I didn't apply alias, fg and redirection.
It is too challengable to me, but other function implementing gave me insights of shell system.
I realized that terminal is one of Shell and I can make custom terminals.

[others]

1. "execvp"

- When I was implementing ", it didn't work. Variable args are filled with empty value. I wanted to use DynArray_toArray function, but the array was not changed well. So I just use indexing.
- I omitted last value of variable args null. At first running time, it works well. But after some operations, the last value of args filled with garbage value. So I initialize it as NULL.
