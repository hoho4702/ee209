# Assignment 5: A Unix Shell

- Name: ChangyongEom

* In this assigment, I worked alone for extra credit and I didn't receive any help from others, plus from any web site.
* In addition, I implement pipe to run command piplines for extra credit.
* I mostly used my own knowledge or some learned concepts from EE209 class: lecture 19(I/O management), 21(process management) and 22(signal)
* From these lectures, I borrow some concepts, e.g. fgets(), fork(), execvp(), handling signal, and so on.
* and after finishing assignment, I feel grateful for a lot of system software in computer like UNIX Shell, redirection, system call etc..
* To complete assignment was very difficult to me, but I can feel very happy since I can be familiar with OS and concepts of computer system.
