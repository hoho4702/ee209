readme file for Assignment 5

- I did this assignment by myself.
- I referred to the signal handling methods learned in the signal lecture. 
- I searched online for the usage of built-in functions related to the 
`cd`, `setenv`, and `unsetenv` commands and utilized them. I noted that 
the `setenv` and `unsetenv` commands cannot accept more than one or two 
arguments, respectively, and added error messages to reflect this.
- I spent about 3 days.
